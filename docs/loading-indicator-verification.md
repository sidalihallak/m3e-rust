The four official sections were read in the preceding review on this date;
actual upstream files/styles were inspected for these fixes. Current values
and reference choices supersede historical measurements below.

Dedicated report created (R12). Shared frame loop now gates reduced motion, pauses elapsed time and cleans unmounted frame state. Seven generated shapes, 48px container and 38px indicator, 650ms shape interval and existing spring retained. Normal path/rotation sampling is recorded in the shared evidence; exact frame matching and OS preference true are untested.

## Checks, dependencies and gaps

- Locked offline Wasm check and fresh Dioxus web build passed; live preview
  was restarted/reloaded and checked for one app-shell.
- [Shared fix matrix, measured results and reproduction steps](component-fidelity-fixes.md)
- [Raw runtime measurements](component-fidelity-fixes-samples.json)
- [Copy dependencies and source export](copy-components.md); exported library
  and all 19 current usage examples compile independently for Wasm.
- Platform scope: desktop pointer/keyboard checks named above. Android remains
  paused; touch, assistive technology and OS reduced-motion true are untested.
  Source gating is not claimed as an OS-preference runtime measurement.
- Historical screenshots/samples below establish only the state and version
  in which they were captured. See the shared fix report for current gaps.
