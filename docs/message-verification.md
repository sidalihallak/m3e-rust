# Message verification —2026-10-12

## Scope and reference

Read rendered official [component catalogue](https://m3.material.io/components),
[accessibility principles](https://m3.material.io/foundations/overview/principles)
and [assistive technology](https://m3.material.io/foundations/overview/assistive-technology)
on2026-10-12. None of these application blocks has a dedicated official Material
component page/spec. Geometry comes from upstream; Material guidance informs
semantic roles, keyboard access, named controls, targets and readable text.
Existing button/icon-button/TextField reports cover reused primitive contracts.

Actual [upstream source](https://github.com/Crysta1221/shadcn-m3e/blob/c37c0d2f6aa3a8ab0b3f195c3ce0f6a568064972/packages/m3e/src/components/message.tsx), revision
c37c0d2f6aa3a8ab0b3f195c3ce0f6a568064972, retrieved2026-10-12.

## Reference contract and implementation

Sources: message.rs and application-blocks.css. MessageGroup gap8px;
Message full width/min0, gap8px, end reverses row order. Avatar minimum32px,
circular clipping and self-end, translated up32px when footer exists. Content
column gap10px; headers/footers12px labels,16px line height,14px horizontal inset,
OnSurfaceVariant. Ghost content removes the inset. Outgoing content aligns end.
Local semantic article/header/footer/time markup extends source div wrappers;
caller supplies the sender and meaningful message labels, image alt text and time.
Message/Bubble composition is separate from scroll controller and app/network state.

## Runtime/build evidence

Desktop raw measurements and tested actions are saved in
[application-blocks-samples.json](application-blocks-samples.json). Screenshots
are in docs/evidence/application-blocks. Results below describe sampled states,
not every permutation. The live Wasm build and fresh independent export are
checked before completion; five copyable usages are included in the gallery.

## Platform scope and gaps

Android remains paused. Desktop/390px geometry does not establish mobile touch,
on-screen keyboard, native Android package behavior or audible screen-reader
announcements. Reduced-motion permutations beyond the sampled states, forced colors, text zoom, full RTL and
all dynamic/unmount/interruption permutations require wider evidence. No claim
of full upstream engine/API parity follows from the sampled core behavior.

## Reproduce

Run ./scripts/dev.sh, wait for successful build, reload the appropriate catalogue
route. Exercise pointer and native keyboard actions, inspect measured state and
focus, and use390px width separately for bounds. Copy the usage and compile a
fresh exported library. Compare the source contract before modifying behavior.

## Final build and evidence

Live Wasm serve: initial42.08s success; final Rust rebuild32.64s success, then
reload before the final inspection. One .app-shell measured. Fresh editable
export /private/tmp/m3e-application-export-1012 compiles its library and all103
examples in12.81s. The only warning is a pre-existing unused ChipSize import.
Five clipboard comparisons are exact: attachment615, bubble512, message417,
scroller527 and questionnaire673 characters. Rust/UI copy instructions and all
required JS/CSS/dependencies are in docs/copy-components.md.

Pilot typography remains Inter; upstream uses Roboto Flex. Full font/pixel
parity is not claimed. Android and audible screen readers remain open. Actual
OS Reduce Motion was sampled for shimmer/jump and restored; other reduced-motion
permutations and forced-colors/zoom/full RTL checks remain.

## Measured desktop and compact results

Incoming Alex and outgoing You expose named article wrappers with sender and
native time metadata. Incoming avatar32px aligns using source footer offset32px.
Message content wraps at390px and respects start/end layout; body375px within
390px. Reactions/action targets and dark-role inheritance were checked through
the Bubble composition. Screenshot/evidence shared with the bubble report.
No audible sender/time announcement or arbitrary avatar/footer size combinations
are established by the DOM/screenshot checks.
